# BBSync
Ruby Scraper for Mizzou Med School Blackboard content.

## OS Support
- Mac OSX
- Windows??? (COULD BE COMPLETELY BROKEN WHO KNOWS)

Sorry, Mac-only support right now. I don't have a Windows machine to test this on. If you need a Linux version, [just ask](https://github.com/KendallPark/bb-sync/issues).

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of BBSync for your OS:
  - [Mac OSX] (https://github.com/KendallPark/bb-sync/raw/master/dist/BBSync-0.0.1-osx.tar.gz)
  - [Windows](https://github.com/KendallPark/bb-sync/raw/master/dist/BBSync-0.0.1-osx.tar.gz)
2. Open the folder.
3. Open the `config.yml` file in a plain text editor (like TextEdit).
4. Fill in your Mizzou pawprint and password. Save the file.
5. Double click `bbsync`.
6. Head over to your `Documents` folder and watch in amazement as BBSync downloads all of your course materials from Blackboard.

Whenever you need to get more content, just double-click `bbsync` again. BBSync will automatically download new content. :)
